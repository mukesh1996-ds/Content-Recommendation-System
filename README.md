# Content Recommendation System for TMDB Movies

This project is a **Content Recommendation System** designed to recommend movies from the **TMDB (The Movie Database)** dataset based on their similarity to other movies. The system leverages **content-based filtering** techniques to suggest movies with similar features. 

The application is developed using **Python**, employs the **Bag of Words (BAG)** model for content similarity, and is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit** app on **Streamlit Cloud** for a seamless user experience.

---

## Features

- **Content-Based Recommendation**: Recommends movies based on their similarity to a selected movie.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly and visually appealing interface built with **Streamlit**.
- **Real-Time Suggestions**: Instantly updates movie recommendations as users interact with the app.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For backend development and data processing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: To implement the **Bag of Words (BAG)** model.
- **Streamlit**: To create and deploy the interactive application.
- **Streamlit Cloud**: For deploying the app and making it accessible online.

---

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Extracted features like genres, keywords, cast, and crew from the TMDB dataset.
   - Combined these features into a single textual format for similarity calculations.

2. **Model Implementation**:
   - Built a **Bag of Words (BAG)** model to calculate the similarity score between movies.
   - Utilized **cosine similarity** to identify the most similar movies.

3. **Streamlit Integration**:
   - Created an interactive UI where users can search and select a movie.
   - Displayed the top recommendations based on the selected movie.
